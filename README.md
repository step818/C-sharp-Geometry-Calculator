# _Area and Volume Calculator_

#### By _**Stephen Trewick**_

## Description

This exercise was designed in C#, mostly meant for me to practice writing tests, but also a console app for users to enjoy. The User is prompted to enter a one of three shapes, `rectangle, square, or circle`, and the length of sides or radius. The console then returns the results of the area and transforms the 2D shape into 3D and returns the volume and surface area.

----------
For example, if the user types `circle`, `2`. The console prints `Circumference: 12.57 , Area: 12.57 , Sphere of Radius 2... Volume: 33.51 , Surface Area: 50.27`.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

In the terminal, `cd ` to the directory folder.

Then `cd` to `Shapes` folder.

Run `dotnet run` to compile and be prompted shortly after.

Enjoy!
